# Krypt 

Krypt is a Web 3.0 app allowing the user to transfer cryptocurrency over the Ethereum blockchain

## Tech Stack

The repository is split between frontend and Web 3.0 components

The frontend architecture is implemented using React and Tailwind CSS whereas the smart contract employs several technologies as mentioned below

### React

- Instead of using npx create-react-app, ViteJS has been used to initialize the project. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

### Tailwind CSS

- A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup without writing any actual css code

### Blockchain

- HardHat provides a local development environment to work with Ethereum

- Solidity is a fairly new language used to work with the Ethereum Blockchain. Inspired by Javascript, Java, C++ and Python, it is a versatile language that reads intuitively and is used to implement smart contracts

- MetaMask is an extension for accessing Ethereum enabled distributed applications

- Alchemy helps us deploy our blockchain smart contract, it is a blockchain development tool

NOTE: Install Metamask to get your Ethereum Wallet setup and interact with the app!
